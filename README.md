# Project 1: Movie Site

## Description

With the use of 3 APIs, we can provide users with information on the 9 movies in the Fast & Furious franchise. When users select a movie from the dropdown menu, they're presented with that movie's title, brief description, plot, and a related video.

From Wikipedia's API, the title and brief are data we fetched. YouTube's API provides a video ID, which we inserted into a URL to embed that video to the page. Lastly, the movie's plot is sourced from OMDb's API.

Using an audio tag, the song, 'Tokyo Drift' plays upon page load.

Local storage is used to save the user's previous dropdown inquiry.
